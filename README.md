# Android App: Inventory App

## Project Information

### About

This project was for my Grow With Google Scholarship Android Basics Nanodegree from Udacity. This app uses SQLite to create, store, and manage a database for a store to keep track of and manage its product listings.

### Concepts

- SQLite to create and manage the database and schema within the app
- Content Providers are used to access the database information
- Custom Cursor Adapters were used to populate a ListView of items stored in the database
- Cursor Loaders were used to handle the loading of data from the database on a background thread
- Intents were used to navigate between pages of the app and to call the provided supplier for each item

## User Interface

The UI consisted of a simple ListView displaying each iPhone in the database. Clicking on each list item opens up an activity where a user can view/edit/update details about the product as well as a button to delete the item entirely from the database. Furthermore, the "ADD IPHONE" button opens an empty detail list where a user can input a new iPhone with its price, quantity, supplier, and other information.
